I can't run away from the thought that when/if I am 85, I can look back with pride and say I made good use of the life that I was given. There are infinite ways to do that because it's what you value but to me, the imagination boils down to:
* I climbed the highest mountains. I don't want to say Everest but I imagine being old and telling stories of what it felt to be on Everest.
* I made a difference. I don't have a specific phrase in mind but I do wish that the work that I did improved human lives. 
* I had a family that was worth doing everything for. I want to look back and say I was in love most of my life and had kids that made the life worth living.

I think these are the things that would be sufficient to conclude that I made it. I find this framework helpful in making decisions and prioritizing.
