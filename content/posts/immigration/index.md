Everyone, regardless of their politics, generally have strong views on immigration and more often than not, they [support legal immigration over illegal](https://news.gallup.com/poll/508520/americans-value-immigration-concerns.aspx). I think most would agree that we need to follow and enforce laws to have a functioning society. I would even say most people who immigrate illegally want to do it legally. But the obscure and dated laws make legal immigration downright painful. I believe both sides generally agree that highly skilled immigrants are a valuable asset to the US economy. Trump recently [said that the](https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/20/politics/trump-green-cards-gradutate-college/index.html) government should give green cards to anyone graduating college. Biden passed [an order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/) that asked to prioritize people who work in AI. 

I am a legal immigrant on the H-1B visa. I work in technology and have lived in the US for 8 years now. I am considered a highly skilled immigrant. Yet, I have no realistic path for permanent residence (green card) and citizenship.  

There are multiple pathways for permanent residence (green card) such as employment, family, investment etc. I fall into the employment based category. Most such categories have a fixed ceiling and quotas based on the country of birth. The law states each country can only get 7% of the total 140,000 employment based green cards per year.

As you can imagine, this doesn't take into account the country's population. India being the most populous country with a dominant tech sector has a large number of tech workers in the green card queue. This essentially means if you're from India, you're disproportionately impacted by the current system. Right now, there are more than [1.2 million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2024/04/14/more-than-1-million-indians-waiting-for-high-skilled-immigrant-visas/) people waiting in line for a green card but they'll have to wait around [150 years](https://www.cato.org/blog/150-year-wait-indian-immigrants-advanced-degrees) for it. 
 

H-1B visas are temporary and were designed to address specific short term needs for businesses. They are limited to a [6 year period](https://www.boundless.com/blog/h-1b-visa-six-year-limit/). That means you can get it renewed many times till a maximum of 6 years. The authorities know about it so they created provisions to extend it indefinitely if you're in the green card line. This basically means people from India will be on this visa forever and thus, will be bound by its strict criteria and bureaucracy.

The H-1B visa literally ties your life to your job. You can't change roles or employers without facing an expensive and long bureaucratic process for a transfer. I have done it twice and it cost about [$8000](https://internationaloffice.berkeley.edu/ucb_departments/h-1b/fees) and 3 months. Not many employers can afford it so there are fewer jobs that sponsor visas. This limits career growth as smaller companies and startups usually don't hire folks on visas. 

Every couple of years, I have to go through the visa renewal process that is intentionally designed to help employers with disregard to the people. Employers file the paperwork that gets everything except the visa stamp on the passport that admits you into the country. Every renewal, I have to go to India to get the visa issued. The process takes about a month where I personally have to travel to the US consulate in a different city. The need for a visa takes away the freedom of travel. Every time I think about visiting my family, I have to meticulously plan around the elusive visa appointment.

Indians face this precarious situation all the time. There are [many instances](https://www.thebulwark.com/p/visiting-family-abroad-has-become-a-glitchy-government-nightmare-for-immigrants) of people not being able to visit their families outside the US. I read [gut wrenching posts of people](https://twitter.com/sumzzzie/status/1490501001001910273) forced to choose between their life here or [attend a parent's funeral](https://twitter.com/PareenMhatre/status/1489983841821507585). It feels immoral to even think that there's a choice here but sadly, that's our reality. 

Living on a visa pauses your life where you don't feel secure. I can't call the US home even after 8 years because if I lose my job I will have 60 days to find another one or leave. In the last couple of years, many of my friends have found themselves in this difficult situation. We all live in fear. You can't buy a house or settle down when you're held by a thin string. Even worse, if something unfortunate happened to the principal visa beneficiary, the entire family would have to leave the country immediately. That could mean uprooting an entire household when they're grieving.


Then there's the impossible choice that [documented dreamers](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/documented-dreamers-overview) (children of long term visa holders) face when they reach 21. These individuals have lived in the US all their lives but they are forced to self deport when they age out of the dependent visa status. They don't get any protection from the law and are excluded from DACA and other such programs. It seems the only mistake their parents made was to follow the law. Congresswoman Deborah Ross has tried and failed to get traction on the issue. It’s just plain cruel to not do something about it. Here’s a [press release](https://ross.house.gov/2023/12/the-growing-backlog-of-green-card-applications-is-disrupting-the-lives-of-indian-nationals-in-nc) from the congresswoman's office.

The constitution grants everyone equal rights but the system discriminates against people based on the country of birth. If an employer can't discriminate based on country of birth, why does the legal status depend on it? Such discriminatory policies are [rooted in racist ideologies](https://www.cato.org/blog/lets-stop-discriminating-against-immigrants-populous-nations) that preferred "white" immigrants over others. The way to enforce it was to create a quota for each country.

However, even after 100 years and all progress made by human society, the discriminatory policies remain. The Biden administration in its effort to alleviate immigration pains made laws that are disheartening to anyone following the law. They created a policy to give [work permits](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/15/us/migrants-work-permits-undocumented.html) to undocumented migrants. I can’t help but shake my head in disbelief that people on visas get 1-3 years of work permits that’s tied to the employer whereas crossing the border illegally gets you a [work permit](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/15/us/migrants-work-permits-undocumented.html) with no strings attached. [This](https://x.com/FrescoLeon/status/1802518063163527488) thread sums up the feeling perfectly.

The extremely restrictive immigration system not only harms human well being but it’s all holding back the 
US economy. [Bipartisan Policy Center](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/) published a [report](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/download/?file=/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/WEB_BPC_Immigration-Green-Light-to-Growth_R01.pdf) on the economic benefits of clearing the backlog and it estimates that would increase the US GDP by $250 billion (employment based) and $3.9 trillion (total) over 10 years. The report is from 2023 and is based on the assumption that the USCIS cleared the entire backlog in 2023.


[A study](https://nfap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Immigrants-and-Billion-Dollar-Startups.NFAP-Policy-Brief.March-2016.pdf) found that 51% of all billion dollar startups were founded by immigrants and a breakdown of that shows that [23%](https://nfap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Immigrants-and-Billion-Dollar-Startups.NFAP-Policy-Brief.March-2016.pdf) (14 out of 60) are Indians. This is huge when we factor in the green card backlog. The 1.2 million Indians in the backlog can’t start a company. [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2021/08/research-why-immigrants-are-more-likely-to-become-entrepreneurs?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block) found that immigrants are more likely to start a company. [Another study](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/immigrants-to-the-u-s-create-more-jobs-than-they-take) looked at the impact of entrepreneurship on job creation and found that “ironically, the result is exactly the opposite of the usual narrative. It seems like immigrants actually improve the economic outcomes for native-born workers.”

There hasn’t been a study that talks about how many of the backlogged folks would become entrepreneurs if they were free to do so. But it’s not hard to see that it would be a large percentage. I am basing the assumption on the fact that I, and many of my friends and peers would do that if we had the freedom.

The Trump administration brought the entire immigration system to a halt. Rather than solving pain points they deliberately created more obstacles for legal immigrants. With Democrats, the Indian community hoped that the discriminatory laws and policies would be fixed but we got policies that are even more disappointing. 


Biden recently issued an [order](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4nnyr4j9w5o) that gives legal pathway to undocumented spouses of US citizens. I am glad that it’s helping people but for someone who followed the law and faces the uncertainty and immense bureaucracy of US immigration, this seems like a slap on the face.

It penalizes everyone following the law. USCIS had a backlog of about [4.3 million cases](https://www.uscis.gov/EOY2023) at the end of 2023 and this number keeps on increasing. The administration did nothing to improve the backlog while handing them a million plus cases. This would impact everyone dealing with USCIS. 

The current wait time for [I-601](https://www.uscis.gov/i-601), which is the current process for undocumented spouses, is [26 months](https://x.com/FrescoLeon/status/1803034709720535152). It essentially means doing the right way takes about 3 years. So it’s not hard to see why folks decide to not follow the law. It’s the government that’s letting everybody down.

This impacts Indians and other legal immigrants in a much more profound way. Apart from slowing everything down, it essentially takes away from green cards from people in line. Now that more green card applications would come in and the allotment is based on country of birth, huge swaths of people would cut in line and worsen the misery of the backlogged community that’s on the whims of USCIS. The most negatively impacted would be applicants in the [family based category](https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-processes-and-procedures/visa-availability-priority-dates/when-to-file-your-adjustment-of-status-application-for-family-sponsored-or-employment-based-103) mainly people from China, India, Mexico and Philippines.

It also impacts the employment based category because of reduced spillover. Spillover is when unused green cards from one category are made available to another. Employment based applicants benefitted from spillover during the pandemic.

Another tragic impact of bogging down the system is the loss of these precious green cards. There are deadlines around these green cards. If they aren’t issued by then, they are wasted. In the system, where people are waiting for decades, wasting these cards is just plain cruel. But this happens more often than we would hope. In 2021, USCIS wasted [230,000 green cards](https://www.boundless.com/blog/uscis-wastes-200k-green-cards-backlog-triples/) because they were unable to process the petitions in time. Every lost green card is a loss of freedom for one individual. 

I can’t underscore enough that there’s a human behind each visa, each green card petition. I wish the people could see it that way and understand that we don’t choose our places of birth but we do choose the places where we build our lives. The US is the only place in the world that truly values talent and hard work. It rewards you with immense opportunities irrespective of where you come from. I hope someday I can have the privilege of calling this place home.
