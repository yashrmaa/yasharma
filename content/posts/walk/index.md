One rainy Sunday I just decided to take a long walk in the city. I imagined I would walk for a couple of hours but it became a full day adventure. The weather was pleasant, it was misty with a breeze. I walked aimlessly with no plans, no destination in mind. I decided on the street when I encountered a turn. I like to live in the moment and experience the world with little expectations. Urban walks are great for this as I don't plan the route or the stops. I just do what I feel like.

I left home around noon with an audiobook called *[Four Thousand Weeks](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/fourthousandweeks)*. Here's the route I took.

I saw so many hidden gems and some famous gems that I wouldn't have visited otherwise. I spent 30 mins at the [Golden Gate Valley library](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Nv6QbQR1DY3kzhir7) reading [Novelist as a Vocation by Haruki Murakami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novelist_as_a_Vocation). I didn't know the author. Now, I have a few of his books on my reading list. 
I saw the [the pink lady mural](https://www.jascharanjiva.com/pink-lady-project) in Hayes. I learned about Jas Charanjiva. Her work is inspirational.

I highly recommend long walks for a fresh dose of the world. To see things you wouldn't normally see and to think about things you wouldn't normally think.
