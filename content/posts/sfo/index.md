This is my 6th time (or maybe it’s 7th, I am not certain) in San Francisco and everytime I come here, I have feelings in the realm of:
* oh, this city could be a paradise but sadly it’s so far away from it.
* It’s pretty meh!
* It’s terrible, why would anyone live here?
* I really wanna like this place but it’s still terrible.

I have wished and tried hard to like this place and I feel so happy that it’s paid off. I think I finally like it. Maybe it’s a fluke, I don’t know. But here I am sipping coffee and looking at Dolores park. There's a cool breeze even though SF is in a heat wave right now. The vibe is so relaxing, everyone seems so chill. 

This neighborhood is not a ghost town unlike others but it’s also not crowded like the East Village or even Upper East Side in NYC. It seems vibrant from this vantage point. I came to Dolores Park because someone I met in Peru lives in Mission Dolores and they had good things to say about the neighborhood. 

At this moment, I feel happy. The reason I have tried to like San Francisco is because it’s the tech capital of the world and I work in tech. It’s a no-brainer to be in the SF but I never liked it. It’s like we all know we need to eat healthy but it just doesn’t taste good and then one day, it starts tasting good. 

Hey there, San Francisco! I’ll make you a permanent fixture, soon!
