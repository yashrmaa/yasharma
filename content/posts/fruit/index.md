I read [Living with a Seal](https://www.amazon.com/Living-SEAL-Training-Toughest-Planet-ebook/dp/B00U6DNZB2) last year and in the book, Jesse Itzler talks about only eating [fruit till noon](https://jesseitzler.com/blogs/free-swim/fruit-til-noon?srsltid=AfmBOoo8e4_OIz6Y6QG2V9URnsFPpYf-K6z2nigK9BEHRoIk9Yln_bpx). It sounds like a healthy change in lifestyle. My usual breakfast is eggs if there's a breakfast at all, which I think is healthy but I am gonna challenge myself to follow Jesse's advice and see if it makes a difference. 

Since, I have already eaten breakfast today, I am gonna start the clock tomorrow. I will update this page throughout the challenge to share how I am feeling. Bonus, I am also gonna try to be sober during this challenge. I might not be able to cut out all alcohol but will definitely reduce it. Alright here we go.
