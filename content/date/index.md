Hey there! Welcome to my [date me doc](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/02/style/date-me-docs.html).

**Upated October 11, 2024**

## About me

I am 5 '10”, 34 M, software engineer at Google. I went to school in India and Texas. I have lived in Delhi, College Station (TX), Plano, Seattle, New York City and San Francisco.


I grew up in a small town in India which was such a blessing to be honest. I have lived in the US for more than 8 years now and I think I have really adapted to the culture here. I am fond of the life I have built.


I work in tech and I believe technology has the potential to make human lives better. It's a double edged sword though. I am cautiously optimistic that we will figure  things out along the way. Personally, I ensure the internet doesn't consume my life. I would encourage everyone to spend a full day without devices. It's a beautiful experience. 


I am a minimalist at heart. I like to live a simple life enriched by experiences. For the past few years, I have been interested in outdoor activities. I would thank Seattle for helping me discover this part of myself. I summited [Mount Rainier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rainier) last year. It was a challenge three years in the making and one of the best adventures to date. I wrote about my experience [here](https://yasharma.xyz/posts/rainier). 

I am curious and adventurous, and I strongly believe in being a better version of myself every day. Some examples would be: 

* Taking cold showers for the past 2 years.
* Learning Spanish aka maintaining Duolingo streak since Jan 2023.
* Learning to play the guitar.
* Spontaneous trip to Peru that included hiking the Salakantay Trek.


The driving force behind everything I do lies in three core elements: *ambition, purpose, and ethics*. I am intentional in building a life that's full of adventures, work that aligns with my purpose, and deep connections.

I am open-minded and believe that we all have independent lives with interests, desires and purpose. The goal is to not have the same lives but to support the other person in building the life they want.

Things I enjoy:

* Spending time with friends. I like to be surrounded by people almost always. 
* Learning (mostly struggling) to play the guitar. Guitar has been a dream for over a decade. This year I am doing something about it.
* Spontaneous trips. I recently did two road trips where we started the car and decided on a direction to drive to.
* Challenging myself. I like this the most. I frequently get inspired by things and try to do something about it.
* Cooking and eating. You don't wanna see my YouTube recommendations haha.
* Hiking, backpacking and maybe, mountaineering (need to survive a big mountain to confidently claim that)


## About you


Honestly, I am a little hesitant here as I have been wrong many times about this part. However, I think it’s important to have some common interests. I am looking for someone who is:

* looking for a life partner and would like to have a monogamous relationship.
* looking to have biological children.
* a little spontaneous and believes in living in the moment.
* intellectually curious and is ready to put in the effort to make both of our lives better. I think wisdom is realizing that nobody’s perfect and you have to put in effort in every aspect of life.
