Hey there! Welcome to my date me doc.

## About me

I am 5 '10”, 33 M, software engineer at Google. I went to school in India and in Texas. I have lived in Delhi, College Station (TX), Plano, Seattle and now New York City.


I grew up in a small town in India which was such a blessing to be honest. I have been living in the US for about 8 years now and I think I have really adapted to the culture here. I am really fond of the life I have in the US.


I work in tech and I would consider myself a techno-optimist who believes technology has the potential to make human lives better. As the internet would tell you, techno-optimism is a polarizing topic and no one thing is the answer to all problems. I like to steer away from doomerism and make incremental progress towards positive outcomes.


I am a minimalist, well I try to be one. I like to live a simple life enriched by experiences. For the past few years, I have been really interested in outdoor activities. I would thank Seattle for helping me discover this part of myself. I recently summited Mount Rainier. It was a challenge three years in the making and one of the best adventures till date. I wrote about my experience here. I am really curious and adventurous, and I want to be a better version of myself every day.


The driving force behind all I do lies in three core elements: *unwavering ambition, a profound sense of purpose, and a deeply rooted compass of ethics and morality*. I yearn for a life brimming with adventurous explorations, fulfilling work that aligns with my purpose, and rich connections with loved ones.

I am open-minded and believe that we all have independent lives with interests, desires and purpose. The goal is to not have the same lives but to support the other person in building the life they want.



## About you


Honestly, I am a little hesitant here as I have been wrong many times about this part. However, I think it’s important to have some common interests. I am looking for someone who is:

* looking for a life partner and would like to have a monogamous relationship.
* looking to have biological children.
* interested in outdoor activities. It’s okay if you don’t want to climb mountains but some interest in hiking/backpacking would be great.
* intellectually curious and is ready to put in the effort to make both of our lives better. I think wisdom is realizing that nobody’s perfect and you have to put in effort in every aspect of life.

If this sounds interesting, please reach out at avjscfhr@duck.com.
