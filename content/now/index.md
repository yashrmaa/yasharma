## Professionally

I work at Google, San Francisco and recently, I have been working on AI in Observability. Software breaks all the time (remember, the recent [CrowdStrike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike_incident) outage?) so naturally, we want to mitigate and prevent issues asap. Systems are designed to leave a paper trail and we engineers use that to understand what went wrong. Now, I am trying to use AI to make that process easier. Imagine a world where an AI tells you "Oh, here's what happened and this is how I fixed it!".

## Personally

* I write sometimes and publish it here. I am trying to be more consistent with this.
* Learning the guitar. Started it three months back.
* Meeting new people. Goal is to talk to someone new everyday. It's hard but that's why I love it. I fail most days but I keep at it.

### Abandoned
* Started building an AI language tutor but wasn't motivated enough to go through with it.
