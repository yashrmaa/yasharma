Hey there!

I am Yash Sharma. I am a software engineer at Google and I live in New York.

At Google, I work on the intersection of AI and observability. The goal is to transform how engineers debug errors. If we're successful, LLMs would understand what went wrong in the production system and recommend a fix with great accuracy.

Before Google, I worked at Microsoft where I was involved in building a technical debt management platform for Windows. The platform formed an integral part of the Windows ecosystem as it let teams create their own tools that seemlessly integrate with the data processing services. I have also worked at Intuit and Samsung.

I am interested in highly scalable distributed systems and AI.
