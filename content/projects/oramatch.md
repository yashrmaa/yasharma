Dating is hard and it's become even harder with the [downfall of dating apps](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2024/02/13/1228749143/the-dating-app-paradox-why-dating-apps-may-be-worse-than-ever) at a time when most of our lives are online. 

OraMatch is trying to solve the problem the old fashioned way. You answer some questions and get matched with people whose answers are similar to yours. The questions are designed to focus on building deep relationships. 

## How does it work?

Simply fill out the questionnaire, and a human assisted matching algorithm will identify compatible individuals based on your preferences. At the end of each month, you'll receive an email with detailed profiles of your top matches, empowering you to initiate contact and explore potential connections.
